I am currently a Research Scientist at the [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov) in the Bay Area. I am part of the [Center for Applied Scientific Computing](https://computing.llnl.gov/casc) where I am working on scientific workflows management at extreme scales.

Before that, I was Computer Scientist at the [Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu/) which is part of the [University of Southern California](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) in Los Angeles. I was part of the [Science Automation Technologies](https://scitech.isi.edu/) group led by [Dr Ewa Deelman](https://deelman.isi.edu/) where I was working on scientific workflows management on large-scale cyber-infrastructures and on optimizing machine learning workflows to run on high-performance systems (HPC).

In 2018, I have defended my PhD in Computer Science at [École Normale Supérieure](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/), France, under the supervision of [Anne Benoit](http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/~abenoit/)
and [Yves Robert](http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/~yrobert/).
I was part of the team [ROMA](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/ROMA/) at the [LIP](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/web-n/), during my PhD I was mainly working on co-scheduling algorithms for large-scale applications.

I have also investigated scheduling and data management problems on the new many-core architectures.

My research interests lie at the intersection of parallel computing and resource management:
- Scheduling problems in HPC and distributed computing
- Resilience & reliability at Exascale
- Scientific workflows management
- Distributed Machine Learning on HPC systems
