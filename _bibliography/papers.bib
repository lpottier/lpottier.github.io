  abstract  = {Big data applications play an increasing role in high-performance computing. They are perfect candidates for co-scheduling, as they obey flexible speedup models, alternating I/O operations and intensive computation phases. In this chapter, we discuss co-scheduling on failure-prone platforms. Checkpointing helps to mitigate the impact of a failure on a given application, but it must be complemented by redistributions to rebalance the load among all applications. Co-scheduling usually involves partitioning the applications into packs, and then scheduling each pack in sequence, as efficiently as possible. The objective is therefore to determine a partition into packs, and an assignment of processors to applications, that minimize the sum of the execution times of the packs. On the theoretical side, we assess the problem complexity. On the practical side, we design several polynomial-time heuristics to deal with the general problem with failures and redistribution costs. The proposed heuristics show very good performance while executing in very short time, hence validating the approach.},

Co-scheduling techniques are used to improve application throughput on such architectures, but sharing resources often generates critical interferences. In this article, we focus on the interferences in the last level of cache (LLC) and use the Cache Allocation Technology (CAT) recently provided by Intel to partition the LLC and give each co-scheduled application their own cache area. We consider m iterative HPC applications running concurrently and answer to the following questions: (i) How to precisely model the behavior of these applications on the cache-partitioned platform? and (ii) how many cores and cache fractions should be assigned to each application to maximize the platform efficiency? Here, platform efficiency is defined as maximizing the performance either globally, or as guaranteeing a fixed ratio of iterations per second for each application. Through extensive experiments using CAT, we demonstrate the impact of cache partitioning when multiple HPC applications are co-scheduled onto CMP platforms.},

Indeed, failures may create severe imbalance between applications and significantly degrade performance.

We propose to redistribute the resources assigned to each application upon the occurrence of failures, and upon the completion of some applications, in order to achieve this goal. First, we introduce a formal model and establish complexity results. The problem is NP-complete for malleable applications, even in a fault-free context. Therefore, we design polynomial-time heuristics that perform redistributions and account for processor failures.

We use extensive simulations to assess the impact of the mapping strategies on performance. We also conduct experiments for a simple 1D Gauss-Seidel kernel, which assess the accuracy of the model and further demonstrate the importance of a tuned memory management.
