I'm currently a computer scientist at the [Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu/) which is part of the [University of Southern California](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) in Los Angeles. I am part of the [Science Automation Technologies](https://scitech.isi.edu/) group led by [Dr Ewa Deelman](https://deelman.isi.edu/) where I am working on scientific workflows management on large-scale cyber-infrastructures and, I am also working on optimizing machine learning workflows to run on high-performance systems (HPC).

I have defended my PhD in Computer Science at École Normale Supérieure (ENS Lyon), France, in 2018, under the supervision of [Anne Benoit](http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/~abenoit/)
and [Yves Robert](http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/~yrobert/).
I was part of the team [ROMA](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/ROMA/) at the [LIP](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/web-n/).
I was mainly working on co-scheduling algorithms for large-scale applications.
I was also working on scheduling and data management problems on the new many-core architectures.
