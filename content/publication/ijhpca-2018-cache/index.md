abstract: ' Cache-partitioned architectures allow subsections of the shared last-level
  cache (LLC) to be exclusively reserved for some applications. This technique dramatically
  limits interactions between applications that are concurrently executing on a multicore
  machine. Consider n applications that execute concurrently, with the objective to
  minimize the makespan, defined as the maximum completion time of the n applications.
  Key scheduling questions are as follows: (i) which proportion of cache and (ii)
  how many processors should be given to each application? In this article, we provide
  answers to (i) and (ii) for Amdahl applications. Even though the problem is shown
  to be NP-complete, we give key elements to determine the subset of applications
  that should share the LLC (while remaining ones only use their smaller private cache).
  Building upon these results, we design efficient heuristics for Amdahl applications.
  Extensive simulations demonstrate the usefulness of co-scheduling when our efficient
  cache partitioning strategies are deployed. '
