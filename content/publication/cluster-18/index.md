abstract: 'Co-scheduling techniques are used to improve the throughput of applications
  on chip multiprocessors (CMP), but sharing resources often generates critical interferences.
  We focus on the interferences in the last level of cache (LLC) and use the Cache
  Allocation Technology (CAT) recently provided by Intel to partition the LLC and
  give each co-scheduled application their own cache area. We consider m iterative
  HPC applications running concurrently and answer the following questions: (i) how
  to precisely model the behavior of these applications on the cache partitioned platform?
  and (ii) how many cores and cache fractions should be assigned to each application
  to maximize the platform efficiency? Here, platform efficiency is defined as maximizing
  the performance either globally, or as guaranteeing a fixed ratio of iterations
  per second for each application. Through extensive experiments using CAT, we demonstrate
  the impact of cache partitioning when multiple HPC application are co-scheduled
  onto CMP platforms.'
