 abstract = { Recently, the benefits of co-scheduling several applications have been demonstrated in a fault-free context, both in terms of performance and energy savings. However, large-scale computer systems are confronted by frequent failures, and resilience techniques must be employed for large applications to execute efficiently. Indeed, failures may create severe imbalance between applications and significantly degrade performance. In this article, we aim at minimizing the expected completion time of a set of co-scheduled applications. We propose to redistribute the resources assigned to each application upon the occurrence of failures, and upon the completion of some applications, in order to achieve this goal. First, we introduce a formal model and establish complexity results. The problem is NP-complete for malleable applications, even in a fault-free context. Therefore, we design polynomial-time heuristics that perform redistributions and account for processor failures. A fault simulator is used to perform extensive simulations that demonstrate the usefulness of redistribution and the performance of the proposed heuristics. },
